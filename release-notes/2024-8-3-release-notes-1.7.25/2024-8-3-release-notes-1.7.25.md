We decided to move to move from wiki.js to docosaurus as latter has more features we need. This change has relatively little effect to the bot overall. Main difference is that only major updates will be released as change logs and those will include all the smaller updates announced before.

Some content hasn't been moved hence we stil host the old documentation. You can visit it at https://old.docs.monni.fyi/


## Changes
- Error handler section of Monni now shows partial error and provides a code to for staff to fetch the full error.
- Error handler now includes possibility of translations.
- Tips can now be translated.
- Added sentry to test how well it can be used for fixing errors.
- Fixed sent command issue.
- Large amount bug fixes and translation changes.
