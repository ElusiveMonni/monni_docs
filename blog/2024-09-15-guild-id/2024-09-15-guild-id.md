When troubleshooting problems it can be useful to know what server a problem is occurring in. One way to quickly locate a server is using the unique Guild ID given to each individual server.

## Finding a Guild ID

Locating the Guild ID first requires turning on Discord's *Developer Mode* which enables options in menus that are primarily used to aid in working with the Discord API.

:::note
If *Developer Mode* has already been enabled then skip to step 3.
