Simpukka v2 is the most ambitious update we have created so far. It reworks how simpukka is sandboxed to allow execution of virtually any language you can think off. The initial feature set is limited to allow for easier testing and finding of issues in the architecture which may require a redoing if everything is added at once. Also a bunch of small changes too.


## Changes
- Added simpukka v2 triggers as alpha option.
- Renamed discord get info to discord whois.
- Made discord whois able to work as user commands and in dms. Also should be able to find member who isn't in a guild.
- Added discord avatar command which sends users avatar.
- Added ephemeral option to discord whois.
- Improved translation of discord whois.
- Added current channel trigger rule.
- Made stable simpukka limit 4x higher.
