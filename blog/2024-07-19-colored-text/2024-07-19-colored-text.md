Discord has the capabilities to display **colored text** through **code blocks** and **syntax highlighting**. The library discord uses for _highlighting_ is **[highlight.js](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js)**. Code blocks also supports **ANSI** which offers a more controllable _coloring experience_.

:::warning
Features discussed in this page **arenâ€™t** currently **supported** on **mobile**!

### Ansi
---
Discord offers support for **ANSI** colored text through code blocks. To get started you need to copy the **escape unicode character** used (`\u001b`). To copy the raw character use the copy button below.

```none

```

Now that you know how to copy the escape character, Letâ€™s go over how the **ANSI** is **structured**. To be able to send colored messages you need to use the **ANSI** language on a **code block**. After that, you need to make sure to use the correct **format** as a _prefix_ before your text. `\u001b[{format code};{ansi code};{ansi code}m`. We will go over the codes later on. To **reset** to **default** use the `\u001b[0m` prefix.

Example message with the `\u001b` character unescaped.
````none
```ansi
[1;31;40mRed text with blue background.
```
````

#### ANSI Codes
---
Codes are split into 3 different categories. **Format**, _text colors_*, and **background colors**. You can set them in any order and set as many of them as you want. The **last code** will **overwrite** the ones before it.

##### Formats
---
- `0`. Default
- `1`. **Bold**
- `4`. Underline

##### Text Colors
---
- `30`. Gray
- `31`. Red
- `32`. Green
- `33`. Yellow
- `34`. Blue
- `35`. Pink
- `36`. Cyan
- `37`. White

![color-example](colored-text-doc/ansi-color-example.png)

##### Backgrounds
---
- `40`. Firefly dark blue
- `41`. Orange
- `42`. Marble blue
- `43`. Greyish turquoise
- `44`. Gray
- `45`. Indigo
- `46`. Light gray
- `47`. White

### Syntax Highlighting
---
There is over **100** supported [languages](https://discord-syntax-highlighting.vercel.app/) and only **a few of them** are **showcased**. In the **code blocks** you can specify _language_ after three backticks ` ```language here``` `.

:::note
**The Code blocks** on this page use a different **color scheme**. They are _provided for ease of copying_ and _testing different examples_.
:::
#### Bash
---
`bash`, `sh`

![bash-example](colored-text-doc/bash-example.png)

# Gray # Supports all characters after the hashtag.
echo exit break test # Colors most linux commands orange.
if elif then # Colors some reserved keywords red.
purple(){ # Colors words before (){ purple.
```
