Monni provides you a way to change language of the software. On guild level the language can be changed from [dashboard](https://monni.fyi/dashboard/). Each user can also set their own preferred language at their [settings](https://monni.fyi/settings/dashboard/localisation). Default language is english and its the language used in case some part of Monni isn't translated. Below is a table showing what language will be chosen in each situation




|   | User language | Guild language | Discord language |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ephemeral command  | <center>**X**</center> |   |
| Direct message | <center>**X**</center>  |   |   |
| Command in guild |   |  <center>**X**</center> |   |
| Message in guild | | <center>**X**</center>|   |
| Slash commands | | | <center>**X**</center>|
