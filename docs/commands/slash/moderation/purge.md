# Purge Command

The Purge Command allows you to delete a set amount of messages from a channel.

Very useful for removing mass NSFW or spam.

## REQUIRE 2FA

If activated, your Moderators will need to use Two Factor Authentication every hour to use the command.

Not reccomended for smaller servers. But very helpful for large servers that are vulnerable to Moderator accounts being hacked.
