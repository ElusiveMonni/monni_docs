### What are arguments
Arguments are extra pieces of information you give to the bot when running a command, for example ID, name, or a number. These can be optional and mandatory.

## How do I use arguments?
Usage of an argument changes slightly depending on the command type. For slash commands, Discord will ask you for the required arguments and offer you the chance to fill optional ones. Prefix command arguments are written after the command in the following manner:

`@Monni command <argument>, <argument>`.
