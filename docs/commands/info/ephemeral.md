# Ephemeral commands

Ephemeral commands are simply put, commands that can only be seen by the person that used it.

You can recognise an ephemeral response by looking at the bottom left of the message. It should say “Only you can see this”.

:::info
Depending on the command they can also send ephemeral messages and such to a targetted member/s.
