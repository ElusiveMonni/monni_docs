## What are guild tokens

**Guild tokens are a way to limit the usage of resource intensive actions without long cooldowns.** This gives you the freedom to decide when to do actions without having to wait.

## How can I get guild tokens

**You get 100 guild tokens for free every month.** Currently there is no way to get more tokens.

## Guild token use cost table

**From the table below you can check how many actions you can do with one token.** (Values are always rounded up). For example 100 roblox related actions would cost 10 tokens.

|Type|actions|
|---|---|
|Roblox|10|
|Nickname|10|

## What is estimated cost?

**In some cases it’s impossible to calculate the token cost before running the actions.** Estimated cost is basically the highest possible action’s usage or in short the worst case scenario.
