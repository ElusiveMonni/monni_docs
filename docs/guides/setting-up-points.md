- **Points System** - Other than custom, this will automatically decide how points will be earned, either through invites or Monni pets!
- **Allow Balance Checking** - Decides whether or not people can use a balance command to check their points
- **Allow Trading** - Decides whether people can send earned points to each other
- **Public Leaderboard** - Decides whether anyone can use the leaderboard command
- **Shop** - Allows you to set certain roles or actions behind a wall that costs points to buy
- **Milestones** - Allows you to set certain roles or actions behind a certain number of points before they are automatically given
