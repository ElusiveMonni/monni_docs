Simpukka is sandboxing mechanism which make creating runtimes for different languages easy. Due to this we are able to support multiple languages for you to use. Each language provides their own wrapper, but they are all based on the same standard which Simpukka API provides.

## Currently supported languages

:::info
Any language which is well-supported also has its own page which explains limitations and what features are supported.
:::
### Python
Python is the best supported language as Monni and underlying sandboxing tooling are written with python.

### Jinja2
Jinja2 is a template engine language built on top off python. It uses the same underlying wrapper as python but makes it easy to create simple and advanced templates.
