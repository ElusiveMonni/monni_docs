# Control Panel

The Control Panel allows you to manage all of your servers via its **tools**, such as [**Mass actions**](/guides/mass-actions).

It also boasts the ability to _Import_ and _Export_ your botâ€™s settings to other servers. See the **HOME section** below for more information on importing and exporting settings.

It also contains **TRIGGERS**.

### Guild Tools

Click on the name of a tool for more information!

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```

# Triggers

Triggers are a very important feature of Monni as they allow you to do nearly anything you need. **Custom Logging Systems**, **Multi Layer Verification**, and **Auto Roling** is all possible.

These triggers can be built with our user friendly action builder as well as a block code editor and code editor.

We highly reccomend you see our detailed page on Triggers.
