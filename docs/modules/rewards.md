###### Module for creating a points shop
***
The Rewards System works in sync with the Points System. Together this makes up the bulk of the Point Shop.
:::info
This Module goes hand in hand with the [**Points Module**](https://monni-docs-f7dj.onrender.com/modules/points).  
So check that out!
:::
### Rewards Configuration
---
The Rewards section is where you can create new items for the Point Shop and Trading. These Items can also be given manually by those with permissions, using commands.  
The Items can be created by clicking “**Create new Item**” in **Reward Settings** and configuring the item to your liking.
:::note
**Badges** can also be created here by clicking the **create badge button.**
:::
#### Items
---
You can name any items you create and give them an image which by default is the thumbnail. You can change this with large image mode which turns it into a discord embed image.

The **Description** allows you to provide extra information when the embed is shown. Like Lore, for example.
:::info
You can select a color for the item which is used as the color of the embed.
:::
:::info
Rarity is the value prepended to the title when an item is displayed as an embed.

#### Badges
---
Badges are simpler than Items and can be given a name and an Emoji. They can be seen with the Discord info command.
