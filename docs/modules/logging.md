Advanced mode allows for adding a Triggers to your Logging Events. This means when something is logged, your Trigger will be activated.

These Triggers can range from changing the nickname of a member, to sending a message or even banning them. Itâ€™s completely up to you.

These Triggers work using [**Simpukka**](https://monni-docs-f7dj.onrender.com/simpukka/).
