###### Module for managing member roles
***
The roles module contains different types of tools which you can use to manage member roles in your server.

See below for details on all of the tools we offer here!
### Role Tools
---
1. **Sticky Roles**
- Sticky Roles are roles that members keep even if they leave and rejoin your server.
- Simply click the box on the tool. Roles will pop up. Any you add will become sticky roles!
2. **Auto Roles**
- Auto Roles are roles which are automatically assigned to members when they join your server.
- Simply click the box on the tool. Roles will pop up. Any you add will become auto roles!
3. **Chain Roles**
- Chain Roles are roles which are assigned to members once they are given another role.
- Simply click the box on the tool. A menu will pop up giving you two editable sections!
	- The first role is the role a member a member needs to be given to receive the second role.
	- If *directional chaining* activated, chaining happens both ways rather than one way.
4. **Reaction Roles**
- Reaction roles are roles your members can “react” to in order to have them assigned to or removed from them.
- In the Roles Module you’ll see the Reaction Roles tool. Here you can select New Reaction Role. A menu will pop up with a few options.
	- **CHANNEL** is where your message or embed will pop up. This will contain your reaction role buttons.
	- **BUTTONS** are the buttons a member can press to have a role assigned to them.  
		- You can turn these buttons into Emojis, Text, or Color.
		- Make sure to select what role the button assigns.
- The configure message button will take you to an embed builder. Here you can create a beautiful embed to attach to your buttons, so members know what buttons do!
